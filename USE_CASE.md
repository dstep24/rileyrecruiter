# Riley Recruiter - Use Case

## TechForward Staffing Agency: Scaling from 3 to 30 Clients

---

## The Challenge

**TechForward** is a boutique recruiting agency specializing in placing software engineers at startups. With just 5 recruiters, they handle:

- **3 client companies**
- **15 open roles**
- **~500 candidate touchpoints per week**

They're turning away business because they can't scale. Hiring more recruiters is expensive ($80K+ per head), slow to ramp (3-6 months), and quality varies.

**The founder's dilemma:** *"We either stay small and profitable, or grow fast and risk quality."*

---

## The Solution: Riley as the 6th Team Member

TechForward deploys Riley as an AI recruiting assistant that handles the high-volume, repetitive work while their human recruiters focus on relationships and closing.

### How Work Gets Divided

| Task | Before Riley | After Riley |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| Sourcing candidates | Recruiter: 3 hrs/day | Riley: Automated |
| Initial outreach | Recruiter: 2 hrs/day | Riley drafts, recruiter approves (20 min) |
| Follow-up messages | Often forgotten | Riley: 100% follow-up rate |
| Interview scheduling | Recruiter: 1 hr/day | Riley: Automated |
| Candidate screening | Recruiter: 2 hrs/day | Riley pre-screens, recruiter reviews (30 min) |
| **Relationship building** | **30 min/day** | **Recruiter: 5+ hrs/day** |

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Onboarding (Shadow Mode)

**What happens:**
1. TechForward uploads their job descriptions, email templates, and company info
2. Riley ingests documents and generates initial Guidelines
3. Riley watches recruiters work, generating "what I would have done" comparisons
4. Teleoperators review Riley's shadow outputs, providing feedback

**Results:**
- Riley learns TechForward's brand voice
- 73% match rate between Riley and human decisions
- Zero risk—Riley takes no actions

### Weeks 2-3: Supervised Mode

**What happens:**
1. Riley starts drafting real outreach messages
2. Every message goes to the approval queue
3. Recruiters approve, edit, or reject each draft
4. Riley learns from every interaction

**Sample Day:**
```
8:00 AM  - Riley drafts 45 personalized outreach messages overnight
8:30 AM  - Sarah (recruiter) reviews queue over coffee
         - Approves 38 messages as-is
         - Edits 5 messages (adds personal touches)
         - Rejects 2 messages (wrong candidate fit)
9:00 AM  - Riley sends approved messages
9:15 AM  - Sarah focuses on phone screens and client calls
```

**Results:**
- 89% approval rate by end of week 3
- Response rate: 18% (up from 12% with manual outreach)
- Time saved: 4 hours per recruiter per day

### Week 4+: Autonomous Mode

**What happens:**
1. Riley handles routine tasks automatically
2. Only sensitive items (offers, complaints, edge cases) go to queue
3. Recruiters focus on high-value activities

**Riley's Daily Output (Autonomous):**
- Sources 200+ candidates across all roles
- Sends 50-80 personalized outreach messages
- Sends 30-40 follow-up messages
- Schedules 10-15 interviews
- Pre-screens 20+ resumes
- Escalates 5-10 items to human review

## Why This Works

### 1. Human Judgment Where It Matters
Riley handles volume; humans handle nuance. Salary negotiations, culture fit assessments, and relationship building stay with recruiters.

### 2. Continuous Learning
Every approval and rejection teaches Riley. After 1,000 interactions, Riley knows TechForward's voice better than a new hire would after 6 months.

### 3. Perfect Follow-Up
Humans forget. Riley never does. The 3rd follow-up (which humans often skip) has a 14% response rate.

### 4. Scale Without Quality Loss
Adding clients doesn't mean quality drops. Riley maintains the same personalization at 10 clients as at 3.

### 5. Recruiter Satisfaction
Recruiters do what they love (relationships) not what they tolerate (data entry). Turnover dropped 40%.
